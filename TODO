maybe like, when the transcription is finished, put the transcription result into the prompt of the next transcription job and tell the llm to keep transcribing.
we will parse the new audio that hasnt been transcribed, with the transcribed result from the previous job already as a prompt for the current job.
we can reuse previous job transcription and parse less audio, faster transcribing.
