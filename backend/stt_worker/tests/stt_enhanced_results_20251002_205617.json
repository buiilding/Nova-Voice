You don't know what out of order is, Mr. Trask.  I'd show you, but I'm too old.  I'm too tired.  I'm too fucking blind.  If I were the man I was five years ago,  I'd take a flamethrower to this place.  Out of order.  Who the hell do you think you're talking to?  I've been around, you know.  There was a time I could see,  and I have seen,  boys like these, younger than these,  their arms torn out, their legs ripped off.  But there is nothing like the sight  of an amputated spirit.  There is no prosthetic for that.  You think you're merely sending this  splendid foot soldier back home to Argon  with his tailbone,  and a tail between his legs,  but I say you are executing his soul!  And why?  Because he's not a bad man.  Bad man.  You hurt this boy, you're gonna be bad bums.  The lot of you.  And Harry, Jimmy, Trent, wherever you are out there,  fuck you too!  Stand down, Mr. Slade.  I'm not finished.  As I came out, I saw you.  I saw you.  I saw you.  I saw you.  I saw you.  I saw you.  I saw you.  I saw you.  I saw you.  I saw you.  I saw you.  I saw you.  I saw you.
